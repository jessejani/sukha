# Sukha - Microlending DApp for Women Entrepreneurs

## Description

**Sukha** is a decentralized microlending platform designed to empower women in vulnerable contexts by providing access to microcredits to develop their economic initiatives. The DApp connects women entrepreneurs seeking financing with lenders interested in supporting the social and economic growth of their communities, fostering a positive and sustainable impact.

The name **Sukha**, derived from Sanskrit, means "happiness" or "well-being." It represents a "good space" that promotes prosperity and peace, aligning with the project's mission of transforming lives and fostering social growth.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Network**: Arbitrum, a scalability solution for Ethereum.
- **Smart Contracts**: Built using **Stylus**, Arbitrum's advanced smart contract tool, and written in **Rust** for high performance and security.
- **Frontend**: Under development to provide a user-friendly and accessible experience.

## Key Features

1. **Microcredit Access**: Women entrepreneurs can apply for funding for projects that generate economic and social impact.
2. **Supportive Lenders**: Users interested in contributing can offer financing, ensuring transparency and security in all transactions.
3. **Security and Transparency**: Smart contracts automate and reliably enforce loan terms.
4. **Community Impact**: Aims to empower not just women but also their families and communities, creating a cycle of well-being.

## How It Works

1. **Registration**:  
   - Entrepreneurs create a profile and describe their project.  
   - Lenders register and browse available projects.

2. **Loan Request**:  
   - Entrepreneurs specify the required amount and the purpose of the loan.  
   - Lenders choose projects they want to fund.

3. **Smart Contract**:  
   - A smart contract is created using **Stylus** on Arbitrum, defining the loan terms (amount, duration, interest, etc.).  
   - The contract ensures compliance, automation, and transparency.

4. **Disbursement and Monitoring**:  
   - Funds are automatically transferred to the entrepreneur via the smart contract.  
   - The contract manages repayments and records transactions.

5. **Repayment and Completion**:  
   - Entrepreneurs make repayments according to the agreed terms.  
   - Lenders receive their returns and can reinvest in new projects.
